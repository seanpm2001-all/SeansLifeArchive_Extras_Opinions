# Seans opinion on adblocking

Adblocking is fundamental for an open Internet. I support adblocking software. Not everyone needs to see ads. Also, in some cases, an adblocker can be a form of anti-virus, due to malvertisements (contrary to popular belief, porn sites aren't the only site that serves malvertisements, even trusted sites like w3schools offers them)

## AdBlockPlus

Not effective enough, but was fine for me before 2020. Ads would get through sometimes, and it was always detected. I switched to uBlock Origin.

## uBlock

Owner went crazy and turned evil. Switch to uBlock Origin

## uBlock Origin

uBlock Origin is an extremely good tracker blocker, diagnostics tool, and doubles as an effective adblocker on all the sites I use, completely undetected (as of March 12th 2021)
